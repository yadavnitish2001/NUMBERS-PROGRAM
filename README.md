# Numbers Program in My Project

## Overview

In this project, numbers play a crucial role, serving as fundamental elements for a wide array of scenarios and addressing various numerical questions.

## Number Operations

We perform a variety of number-related operations to handle different use cases within the project, including:

- **Armstrong Number Check:**
  - Identifying Armstrong numbers, where the sum of each digit raised to the power of the number of digits equals the original number.

- **Automorphic Number Check:**
  - Verifying automorphic numbers, which remain unchanged when their square is found. For example, 5 is an automorphic number as 5^2 = 25, and 25 ends with 5.

- **Palindrome Number Check:**
  - Determining whether a number reads the same forward and backward.

- **Additional Number Operations:**
  - Any other relevant number-related operations or questions specific to our project.

All the number-related questions and operations are documented in the project, providing detailed information for each operation. Refer to the corresponding documentation or instructions for a comprehensive understanding of each numerical concept.
