The logic of print Prime numbers from 1-n are:
A prime number is a number that is divisible by only two numbers: 1 and itself. 
So, if any number is divisible by any other number, it is not a prime number.

The logic are:
Read or initialize the number
Using the for loop and initialize i=2 to i<=n
Take another variable (count) to count the number and initialize it to 0.
Using the  another for loop and initialize j=2 to i<=n
Inside the loop check 'if'condition ,weather the i is divisible by j or not
if i is divisible by j and gives remainder 0 then increase the count value
Repeat the above step until the condition is false.
if the condition become false then print the prime numbers
