What is logic of  fibonacci series?
In fibonacci series, next number is the sum of previous two numbers 
for example 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55 etc. The first two numbers of fibonacci series are 0 and 1.

The logic are:
Read or initialize number.
initialize and declare x=0 ,y=1 and z=0;
using for loop,Run a loop for n1  from i to max of n and iterative a loop until the condition become false
The the print the value o loop x
The next terms in the Fibonacci series would be calculated as:
z=x+y;
x=y;
y=z;
Loop runs until the condition become false
