The logic of print even number from 1-n:-
A number that is divisible by 2 and generates a remainder of 0 is called an even number.
Take the user input as a n number
create the loop from integer i=1 to i<=n
Inside the loop check weather the number is divisible by 2 or not
Check condition:(i%2==0) to check weather number is divisible by 2 and generates a remainder of 0 is called an even number.
keep doing until the condition is false
if condition is false,Then exit from loop and print the even number
