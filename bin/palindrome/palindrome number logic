What is the logic of palindrome?
The logic of a palindrome is simple, wherein if we take a number and reverse it, it still stays the same as the original number.
 For example, 10101 is a palindrome number as it is going to stay the same even if we reverse it.
 The logic is:
 
Read or initialize number.
First, Declare a variable reverse and initialize it with 0.
Now, make a while loop till the original number is greater than zero.
In every loop get the last digit of the number and add that digit at the end of the reverse and then, divide the original number by 10.
reverseNum = reverseNum * 10 + (number % 10)
Lastly, check if the original number and reverse number are equal or not.
Then print the reverse number
