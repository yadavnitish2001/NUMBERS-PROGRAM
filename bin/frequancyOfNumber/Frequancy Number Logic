What is logic of frequancy?
frequancy means counts the number of digits in a number
for eg:-12234,if you select 2 then 2 present 2 times

The logic are:
Read or initialize number and digits.
Declare and initialize temp=n,rem,and count=0;
using while loop execute until the condition becomes false ((temp>0))
determines the last digit from the number(rem=temp%10);
using another condition 'if' and compare rem==m or not ,if condition true then increase the count variable{(rem==m) count++};
Remove last digits(temp=temp/10);
Repeat the above step  until the condition becomes false.
Then print the results
