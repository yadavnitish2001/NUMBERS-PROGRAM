What is logic of  Greatest Common Divisor(gcd):
It is the highest number that completely divides two or more numbers. 
Example: Find the GCF of 12 and 8.
Solution:
Factors of 12: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12
Factors of 8: 1, 2, 4, 8
Common Factors: 1, 2, 4
Greatest Common Factor: 4
Hence, the GCF of 12 and 8 is 4.
\
The logic are:
Declare two variables, say n1 and n2.
Initialize variable gcd=1;
using for loop,Run a loop for n1 and n2 from i to max of n1 and n2.
Check that the number divides both (n1 and n2) numbers completely or not. If divides completely storing the variable i in the variable gcd  
check the condition, until the condition become false
if condition become false,Then print the value of gcd
