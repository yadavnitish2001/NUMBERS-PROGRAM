The logic of print power of any number is:'
for eg:-(2)^2=4

Read or initialize base and exponent.
Take another variable (power) to store the result and initialize it to 1.
Using the for loop or while loop,
multiply the base by power and store the result into power.
Repeat the above step (3) until the exponent becomes 0.
Then print the results
