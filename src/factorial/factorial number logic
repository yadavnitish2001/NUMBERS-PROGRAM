What is logic of factorial number?
Factorial of n is the product of all positive descending integers. Factorial of n is denoted by n!.
For example:
4! = 4*3*2*1 = 24  
5! = 5*4*3*2*1 = 120  

The logic of factorial number:-
Read or initialize number.
initialize and declare fac=1;
using for loop,Run a loop for n from i to max of n.
multiply the numbers with fac and stored in factorial(fac=fac*n) and then decrease the  number(n--)
Run the for  loop till the  number is greater.
If the condition become false and print the factorial.
