he logic of print Sum of square of  number is:
For example:1 2 3 4=(1)^2+(2)^2+(3)^2+(4)^2=1+4+9+16=30,The sum square of number is 30

Read or initialize Number.
Take another variable (sum) to store the addition of a number and initialize it to 0.
for using 'for'loop and it begins and runs till value is i<=n
increment the value of i after each iteration until the condition becomes false
taking the i for square and adding in variable sum  
sum=sum+i:Taking the i value and adding it in sum
Print the sum  of  natural number
